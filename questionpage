> Write a Java program to create a class called Vehicle with a method called drive().

 > Create a subclass called Car that overrides the drive() method to print "Repairing a car".
For more hands on, do the following to the classes created above:
> Write a Java program where the "Car" subclass includes a method to check fuel level and alert when low.
> Write a Java program where the "Vehicle" class has a method to check engine status, and subclasses override it.
> Write a Java program where the "Car" subclass adds a feature to calculate trip cost based on fuel consumption.
> Write a Java program where the "Vehicle" class includes an attribute for speed, and
 subclasses modify speed based on type.
