# Exercise 2: Vehicle and Car â€“ Java Inheritance

## Overview

This exercise builds a simulation of a `Vehicle` and a `Car` using **method overriding** and **custom attributes**.

## Tasks Covered

- Define a class `Vehicle` with a `drive()` method.
- Create a subclass `Car` that overrides `drive()` with `"Repairing a car"`.

### Additional Hands-On Tasks

- Add a method in `Car` to check fuel level and alert when low.
- Add a method to check engine status in `Vehicle`, and override it.
- Add a method in `Car` to calculate trip cost using fuel consumption.
- Add a `speed` attribute in `Vehicle`, modified differently by subclasses.

## Concepts Practiced

- Inheritance & Overriding
- Composition of Real-World Entities
- Custom Method Implementation

## Notes

This simulation is ideal for understanding how to extend base classes with more specific behaviors while maintaining shared functionality.
